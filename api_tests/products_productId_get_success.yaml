# This test scenario checks whether the API endpoint "/products/{productId}" is working correctly or not.
# It sends a GET request to the API endpoint with a valid productId taken from a CSV file.
# The request also includes an Authorization header which is taken from the environment variable.
# After sending the request, it waits for a second before proceeding to the next iteration.
# The test checks if the status code of the response is 200 and if the response body contains the properties "name", "id", "description", and "price".
# It also checks if the response body contains the productId that was sent in the request.
# If all these conditions are met, the test is considered successful.
