Scenario 1: Valid Track ID with Multiple Tracks
Details:
  TestName: test_track_for_id_multiple_tracks
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the track_for_id function is able to correctly retrieve and yield all TrackInfo objects associated with a valid track_id when multiple tracks are associated with the same ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the find_plugins function to return a list of plugins. Each plugin should be mocked to return a TrackInfo object when track_for_id is called with the test track_id.
  Act: Call track_for_id with the test track_id.
  Assert: Verify that all TrackInfo objects returned by the plugins are yielded by the function.
Validation:
  The test verifies that the function correctly handles the case where multiple tracks are associated with the same ID, which is a common occurrence in music libraries with multiple versions of the same song.

Scenario 2: Valid Track ID with a Single Track
Details:
  TestName: test_track_for_id_single_track
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the track_for_id function correctly retrieves and yields a single TrackInfo object associated with a given valid track_id.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the find_plugins function to return a list of plugins. One plugin should be mocked to return a TrackInfo object when track_for_id is called with the test track_id, while the others should return None.
  Act: Call track_for_id with the test track_id.
  Assert: Verify that the TrackInfo object returned by the plugin is yielded by the function.
Validation:
  The test verifies that the function correctly handles the case where only one track is associated with a given ID, which is a common occurrence in music libraries.

Scenario 3: Invalid Track ID
Details:
  TestName: test_track_for_id_invalid_id
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the track_for_id function correctly handles the case where an invalid track_id is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the find_plugins function to return a list of plugins, all of which should be mocked to return None when track_for_id is called.
  Act: Call track_for_id with an invalid track_id.
  Assert: Verify that the function does not yield any TrackInfo objects.
Validation:
  The test verifies that the function correctly handles the case where an invalid track_id is provided, which is an important edge case to test in order to ensure robust error handling. 

Scenario 4: No Plugins Found
Details:
  TestName: test_track_for_id_no_plugins
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the track_for_id function correctly handles the case where no plugins are found.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the find_plugins function to return an empty list.
  Act: Call track_for_id with a valid track_id.
  Assert: Verify that the function does not yield any TrackInfo objects.
Validation:
  The test verifies that the function correctly handles the case where no plugins are found, which is an important edge case to test in order to ensure robust error handling.
