Scenario 1: Testing the _length method with an album
Details:
  TestName: test_length_with_album
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the _length method correctly sums up the lengths of all items in an album when the second parameter is set to True. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of objects with a length attribute. Set the second parameter of the _length method to True.
  Act: Invoke the _length method with the list of objects and the second parameter.
  Assert: The expected outcome is the sum of the lengths of all objects in the list. This will be checked by comparing the output of the method with the expected sum.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the _length method correctly calculates the total length of all items in an album.

Scenario 2: Testing the _length method with a single item
Details:
  TestName: test_length_with_single_item
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the _length method correctly returns the length of a single item when the second parameter is set to False.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object with a length attribute. Set the second parameter of the _length method to False.
  Act: Invoke the _length method with the object and the second parameter.
  Assert: The expected outcome is the length of the object. This will be checked by comparing the output of the method with the expected length.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the _length method correctly calculates the length of a single item.

Scenario 3: Testing the _length method with an empty album
Details:
  TestName: test_length_with_empty_album
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the _length method correctly handles an empty album, returning 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty list. Set the second parameter of the _length method to True.
  Act: Invoke the _length method with the empty list and the second parameter.
  Assert: The expected outcome is 0. This is checked by comparing the output of the method with 0.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the _length method correctly handles edge cases, such as an empty album.

Scenario 4: Testing the _length method with None object
Details:
  TestName: test_length_with_none_object
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the _length method correctly handles a None object, returning None.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the object parameter of the _length method to None. Set the second parameter to False.
  Act: Invoke the _length method with None object and the second parameter.
  Assert: The expected outcome is None. This is checked by comparing the output of the method with None.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the _length method correctly handles edge cases, such as a None object.
