Scenario 1: Test with an empty list of plugins
Details:
  TestName: test_album_distance_with_no_plugins
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behavior when no plugins are available to calculate the album distance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an empty list of plugins.
  Act: Invoke the function album_distance with the empty list of plugins.
  Assert: The expected outcome is a Distance object with no updates, as there were no plugins to provide updates.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles the scenario of no plugins gracefully, without throwing exceptions or errors, and returns a valid Distance object.

Scenario 2: Test with a single plugin
Details:
  TestName: test_album_distance_with_single_plugin
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behavior when there is only one plugin available to calculate the album distance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list with a single plugin.
  Act: Invoke the function album_distance with the single plugin.
  Assert: The expected outcome is a Distance object updated by the single plugin.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly processes a single plugin and updates the Distance object accordingly. This is a common scenario and it is essential that it works as expected.

Scenario 3: Test with multiple plugins
Details:
  TestName: test_album_distance_with_multiple_plugins
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behavior when multiple plugins are available to calculate the album distance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list with multiple plugins.
  Act: Invoke the function album_distance with the list of multiple plugins.
  Assert: The expected outcome is a Distance object updated by all the plugins.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly processes multiple plugins and updates the Distance object with each plugin's contribution. This is the most common scenario and it is critical for the function to handle it correctly.

Scenario 4: Test with a plugin that throws an exception
Details:
  TestName: test_album_distance_with_exception_plugin
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behavior when one of the plugins throws an exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of plugins where one of them is designed to throw an exception.
  Act: Invoke the function album_distance with the list of plugins.
  Assert: The expected outcome is that the function handles the exception gracefully and continues processing the remaining plugins, if any.
Validation:
  This is an important test as it verifies the function's robustness and ability to handle exceptions. It ensures that a failure in a single plugin does not halt the processing of the remaining plugins.
