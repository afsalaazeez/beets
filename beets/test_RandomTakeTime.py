Scenario 1: Test with no items in the iterator
Details:
  TestName: test_empty_iterator
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's ability to handle an empty iterator.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty list as the iterator.
  Act: Invoke the function with the empty iterator, a random number of seconds, and a random album.
  Assert: The returned list should be empty.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks the function's capability to handle edge cases where there are no items in the iterator.

Scenario 2: Test when total time of items exceeds the provided seconds
Details:
  TestName: test_items_exceed_seconds
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly stops adding items when the total time exceeds the provided seconds.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an iterator with items whose total length exceed the provided seconds.
  Act: Invoke the function with the iterator, a certain number of seconds, and a random album.
  Assert: The returned list should contain items that add up to less than or equal to the provided seconds.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks the function's primary functionality, ensuring that it behaves as expected when the total time of items exceeds the provided seconds.

Scenario 3: Test when total time of items is less than the provided seconds
Details:
  TestName: test_items_less_than_seconds
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly adds all items when the total time is less than the provided seconds.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an iterator with items whose total length is less than the provided seconds.
  Act: Invoke the function with the iterator, a certain number of seconds, and a random album.
  Assert: The returned list should contain all items from the iterator.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks if the function behaves as expected when the total time of items is less than the provided seconds.

Scenario 4: Test with single item in the iterator
Details:
  TestName: test_single_item_iterator
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's ability to handle an iterator with only one item.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an iterator with a single item.
  Act: Invoke the function with the iterator, a certain number of seconds, and a random album.
  Assert: The returned list should contain the single item if its length is less than or equal to the provided seconds. Otherwise, it should be empty.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks the function's capability to handle edge cases where there is only one item in the iterator.

Scenario 5: Test when item length is equal to the provided seconds
Details:
  TestName: test_item_length_equal_seconds
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly adds the item when its length is exactly equal to the provided seconds.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an iterator with an item whose length is equal to the provided seconds.
  Act: Invoke the function with the iterator, the same number of seconds, and a random album.
  Assert: The returned list should contain the item.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks if the function behaves as expected when an item's length is exactly equal to the provided seconds.
