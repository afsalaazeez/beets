Scenario 1: Test to validate if the commands method returns a list of Subcommand objects from all loaded plugins.
Details:
  TestName: test_commands_return_list_of_subcommands
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the commands method correctly returns a list of Subcommand objects from all loaded plugins.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the find_plugins method to return a list of plugin objects. Each plugin object should have a commands method that returns a list of Subcommand objects.
  Act: Invoke the commands method.
  Assert: Check if the return value is a list of Subcommand objects.
Validation:
  The test validates the business requirement that the commands method should return a list of Subcommand objects from all loaded plugins. This is important as it ensures the method correctly interacts with plugins and fetches the required data.

Scenario 2: Test to validate if the commands method returns an empty list when no plugins are loaded.
Details:
  TestName: test_commands_return_empty_list
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the commands method correctly returns an empty list when no plugins are loaded.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the find_plugins method to return an empty list.
  Act: Invoke the commands method.
  Assert: Check if the return value is an empty list.
Validation:
  The test validates the business requirement that the commands method should return an empty list when no plugins are loaded. This is important as it ensures the method correctly handles the scenario when no plugins are loaded.

Scenario 3: Test to validate if the commands method correctly concatenates the lists of Subcommand objects from multiple plugins.
Details:
  TestName: test_commands_concatenate_subcommands
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the commands method correctly concatenates the lists of Subcommand objects returned by the commands method of each plugin.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the find_plugins method to return a list of plugin objects. Each plugin object should have a commands method that returns a list of Subcommand objects.
  Act: Invoke the commands method.
  Assert: Check if the return value is a list of Subcommand objects that is the concatenation of the lists returned by the commands method of each plugin.
Validation:
  The test validates the business requirement that the commands method should correctly concatenate the lists of Subcommand objects returned by the commands method of each plugin. This is important as it ensures the method correctly fetches all the Subcommand objects from multiple plugins.

Scenario 4: Test to validate if the commands method handles exceptions thrown by the commands method of a plugin.
Details:
  TestName: test_commands_handles_exception
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the commands method correctly handles exceptions thrown by the commands method of a plugin.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the find_plugins method to return a list of plugin objects. One of the plugin objects should have a commands method that throws an exception.
  Act: Invoke the commands method.
  Assert: Check if the commands method correctly handles the exception and continues to process the remaining plugins.
Validation:
  The test validates the business requirement that the commands method should correctly handle exceptions thrown by the commands method of a plugin. This is important as it ensures the method is robust and can handle errors during execution.
