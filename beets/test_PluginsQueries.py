Scenario 1: Test when no plugins are loaded
Details:
  TestName: test_queries_no_plugins
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function behavior when there are no plugins loaded. The function is expected to return an empty dictionary in such case.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call the queries function.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is an empty dictionary.
Validation:
  This test is important to verify the function's behavior in the absence of any plugins. According to the function's specifications, it should return an empty dictionary when no plugins are loaded.

Scenario 2: Test when one plugin is loaded
Details:
  TestName: test_queries_one_plugin
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function behavior when there is one plugin loaded. The function is expected to return a dictionary mapping prefix strings to Query subclasses of the loaded plugin.
Execution:
  Arrange: Load a single plugin.
  Act: Call the queries function.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is a dictionary with keys and values corresponding to the loaded plugin's queries.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly identifies and returns the queries of a single loaded plugin. The expected result aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 3: Test when multiple plugins are loaded
Details:
  TestName: test_queries_multiple_plugins
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function behavior when there are multiple plugins loaded. The function is expected to return a dictionary containing prefix strings and Query subclasses from all loaded plugins.
Execution:
  Arrange: Load multiple plugins.
  Act: Call the queries function.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is a dictionary with keys and values corresponding to the queries of all loaded plugins.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies and returns the queries of all loaded plugins. The expected result aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 4: Test with duplicate queries across plugins
Details:
  TestName: test_queries_duplicate_queries
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function behavior when there are duplicate queries across plugins. The function is expected to return a dictionary containing unique prefix strings and Query subclasses from all loaded plugins.
Execution:
  Arrange: Load multiple plugins with some duplicate queries.
  Act: Call the queries function.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is a dictionary with unique keys and values corresponding to the queries of all loaded plugins.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies and returns unique queries even when there are duplicates across plugins. The expected result aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements.
