Scenario 1: Validate the functionality when a valid album_id is provided
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_album_id
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the `album_for_id` function returns the correct AlbumInfo object when a valid album_id is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the album_id with a valid value and mock the `find_plugins` and `plugin.album_for_id` functions to return expected results.
  Act: Invoke the `album_for_id` function with the initialized album_id.
  Assert: Check that the returned AlbumInfo object matches the expected result.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the expected result's connection to the function's specifications and business requirements. This test ensures that the function correctly retrieves the AlbumInfo object for a valid album_id, which is the core functionality of the function.

Scenario 2: Validate the functionality when an invalid album_id is provided
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_album_id
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the `album_for_id` function returns None or doesn't yield anything when an invalid album_id is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the album_id with an invalid value and mock the `find_plugins` and `plugin.album_for_id` functions to return None.
  Act: Invoke the `album_for_id` function with the initialized album_id.
  Assert: Check that the function doesn't yield anything or returns None.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles invalid album_id and doesn't return incorrect results, which is essential for the function's error handling.

Scenario 3: Validate the functionality when no plugins are found
Details:
  TestName: test_no_plugins_found
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the `album_for_id` function doesn't yield anything or returns None when no plugins are found.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the album_id with a valid value and mock the `find_plugins` function to return an empty list.
  Act: Invoke the `album_for_id` function with the initialized album_id.
  Assert: Check that the function doesn't yield anything or returns None.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case where no plugins are found, which is essential for its robustness.

Scenario 4: Validate the functionality when multiple plugins are found
Details:
  TestName: test_multiple_plugins_found
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the `album_for_id` function correctly iterates over all the plugins and returns the AlbumInfo object for each plugin that has the given album_id.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the album_id with a valid value and mock the `find_plugins` and `plugin.album_for_id` functions to return multiple plugins and AlbumInfo objects respectively.
  Act: Invoke the `album_for_id` function with the initialized album_id.
  Assert: Check that the function yields all the expected AlbumInfo objects.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case where multiple plugins are found and retrieves the AlbumInfo object for each of them, which is essential for its comprehensive functionality.
