Scenario 1: Test find_plugins function when cached instances exist
Details:
  TestName: test_find_plugins_with_cached_instances
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the find_plugins function correctly returns the cached instances when they exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize some plugin instances in the _instances variable.
  Act: Call the find_plugins function.
  Assert: Check that the returned list matches the cached instances.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function is correctly using cached instances for performance reasons, as per the business logic.

Scenario 2: Test find_plugins function when no cached instances exist
Details:
  TestName: test_find_plugins_without_cached_instances
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the find_plugins function correctly loads plugins, instantiates them and caches them when no cached instances exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure the _instances variable is empty.
  Act: Call the find_plugins function.
  Assert: Check that the returned list contains the correct plugin instances and that these instances have been cached in the _instances variable.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case where no instances are cached, which is a crucial part of its business logic.

Scenario 3: Test find_plugins function with some cached instances and some new instances
Details:
  TestName: test_find_plugins_with_mixed_instances
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the find_plugins function correctly handles a mix of cached and new instances.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize some plugin instances in the _instances variable and ensure there are some new plugin classes in the _classes variable.
  Act: Call the find_plugins function.
  Assert: Check that the returned list contains the correct mix of cached and new instances and that the new instances have been cached in the _instances variable.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly handles a mix of cached and new instances, which is a crucial part of its business logic and can occur in realistic usage scenarios. 

Scenario 4: Test find_plugins function when load_plugins function throws an exception
Details:
  TestName: test_find_plugins_with_load_plugins_exception
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the find_plugins function correctly handles exceptions thrown by the load_plugins function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the load_plugins function to throw an exception.
  Act: Call the find_plugins function.
  Assert: Check that the function handles the exception correctly and does not crash.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function is robust and can handle errors in its dependencies, an important aspect of its business logic.
