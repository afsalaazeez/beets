Scenario 1: Test to validate random object selection without equal chance
Details:
  TestName: test_random_objs_without_equal_chance
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function returns a random subset of the provided objects without giving each object an equal chance of being selected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of objects and a number for the subset.
  Act: Invoke the random_objs function with the objects and the number, without setting equal_chance.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned list contains the correct number of objects and that they are elements of the original list.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the basic functionality of the function, ensuring it can select a specified number of objects at random.

Scenario 2: Test to validate random object selection with equal chance
Details:
  TestName: test_random_objs_with_equal_chance
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function returns a random subset of the provided objects, giving each object an equal chance of being selected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of objects and a number for the subset.
  Act: Invoke the random_objs function with the objects, the number, and set equal_chance to True.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned list contains the correct number of objects and that they are elements of the original list.
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it checks that the function correctly balances the chance of each object being selected, ensuring fairness in the selection process.

Scenario 3: Test to validate object selection by time
Details:
  TestName: test_random_objs_by_time
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function selects a list of objects whose total time is close to the provided number of minutes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of objects and a time in minutes.
  Act: Invoke the random_objs function with the objects and the time.
  Assert: Confirm that the total time of the returned objects is close to the provided time.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies that the function can select objects based on their total time, a key requirement of the function's specifications.

Scenario 4: Test to validate the function when no number or time is provided
Details:
  TestName: test_random_objs_no_number_or_time
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behavior when neither a number nor a time is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of objects.
  Act: Invoke the random_objs function with only the objects.
  Assert: Confirm the function's behavior, which could be returning a default number of objects or raising an error.
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it checks the function's robustness in handling cases where optional parameters are not provided.

Scenario 5: Test to validate the function with a custom random generator
Details:
  TestName: test_random_objs_custom_random_gen
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function uses a provided random generator instead of the default.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of objects, a number for the subset, and a custom random generator.
  Act: Invoke the random_objs function with the objects, the number, and the custom random generator.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned list contains the correct number of objects and that they are elements of the original list, and that the custom random generator was used.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies the function's flexibility in using different random generators, allowing for more control over the randomness of the object selection.
