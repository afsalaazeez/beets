Scenario 1: Validating the successful retrieval of item candidates
Details:
  TestName: test_item_candidates_valid_retrieval
  Description: This test is designed to validate that the item_candidates method successfully retrieves candidates from the plugins.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the find_plugins function to return a list of plugins. Each plugin should have a mock item_candidates method that returns a predefined list of candidates.
  Act: Call the item_candidates method with a mock item, artist, and title.
  Assert: Verify that the returned list of candidates matches the combined list of candidates returned by each plugin's item_candidates method.
Validation:
  This test is essential to ensure that the item_candidates function correctly aggregates and returns the candidates from all plugins. This is a core part of the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 2: No plugins found
Details:
  TestName: test_item_candidates_no_plugins
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the item_candidates method behaves correctly when no plugins are found.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the find_plugins function to return an empty list.
  Act: Call the item_candidates method with a mock item, artist, and title.
  Assert: Verify that the item_candidates method returns an empty list.
Validation:
  It's important to test this scenario to ensure the function handles the situation gracefully when no plugins are found, which is a possible real-world scenario.

Scenario 3: Plugin's item_candidates method raises an exception
Details:
  TestName: test_item_candidates_plugin_exception
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the item_candidates method handles exceptions thrown by a plugin's item_candidates method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the find_plugins function to return a list of plugins. One of these plugins should have a mock item_candidates method that raises an exception.
  Act: Call the item_candidates method with a mock item, artist, and title.
  Assert: Verify that the item_candidates method returns the list of candidates from the other plugins and does not raise an exception.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the item_candidates function is robust and can handle exceptions from the plugins. The function should continue to work even if one plugin fails, as per its specifications and business requirements.
